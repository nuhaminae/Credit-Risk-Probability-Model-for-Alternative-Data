# Credit-Risk-Probability-Model-for-Alternative-Data

## Overview

This repository contains a project for developing a credit scoring model by transforming behavioural data into a predictive risk signal. The aim is to leverage alternative data sources to improve the accuracy of credit risk assessment, particularly in scenarios where traditional credit data may be limited or unavailable.

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### 1. Why Model Interpretability Matters under Basel II
The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to rigorously measure, monitor, and manage credit risk, especially for capital adequacy calculations. This regulatory framework places a premium on transparency, interpretability, and auditability of risk models. As a result, credit scoring models must be not only accurate but also interpretable and well-documented. This ensures regulators, auditors, and internal stakeholders can clearly understand how scores are generated, how input variables affect outcomes, and how risk is being quantified, thus maintaining compliance and facilitating trust in the model’s outputs.

### 2. The Need for a Proxy Default Label
In the absence of a direct "default" label in the data, one must define a proxy variable (such as "90+ days past due") to approximate default behavior. This proxy is essential for supervised learning, as models require a clear target variable. However, predictions based on a proxy carry business risks: they may not fully capture the real-world definition of default as used by regulators or the institution, leading to potential misclassification. This can result in inaccurate risk assessments, suboptimal lending decisions, or regulatory misalignment if the proxy diverges significantly from actual default patterns.

### 3. Key Trade-offs: Simplicity vs. Complexity in Model Choice
Simple, interpretable models (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence encoding) offer clear explanations for decisions, easier validation, and regulatory acceptance—crucial for compliance and governance. However, they may sacrifice some predictive power compared to more complex approaches. High-performance models (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines) can yield better accuracy but are harder to interpret and validate, increasing the risk of regulatory challenges and implementation hurdles. In regulated environments, the trade-off often favors interpretability and transparency over marginal gains in predictive accuracy, unless the complexity can be justified and thoroughly documented.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer (recommended)
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/) (for data version control)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nuhaminae/Credit-Risk-Probability-Model-for-Alternative-Data.git
   cd Credit-Risk-Probability-Model-for-Alternative-Data
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .credvenv
   # On Windows:
   .credvenv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix/macOS:
   source .credvenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Set up DVC:**
   ```bash
   dvc pull
   ```

## Usage

All data science and modelling work is performed in the `notebooks` directory using Jupyter notebooks. To start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open any of the provided notebooks to explore exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

### Data Processing

Raw data should be placed in the `data/raw/` directory. Processed datasets and model outputs will be saved to `data/processed/`.

## Data Description

The project is designed to work with behavioural and alternative data sources.
*Note: The actual datasets used are not included in the repository due to privacy and regulatory reasons. Sample data schemas may be provided in the notebooks.*

## Modelling Approach

The workflow typically follows these steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding data distributions, missing values, and initial patterns.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Deriving meaningful features from raw behavioural data.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Evaluating various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting).

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Using cross-validation and appropriate metrics (e.g., F1-score).

5. **Interpretability:**
   - Analysing feature importance and model explainability.

6. **Deployment:**
   - The model can be exported for use in production environments.

## Testing

Continuous integration is set up using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). This runs basic tests such as checking Python version and installing dependencies.

To run tests locally, ensure your environment is activated and use:

```bash
python --version
# Add more test commands as appropriate for your project
```
